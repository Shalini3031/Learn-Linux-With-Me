# Learn-Linux-With-Me
Exploring Linux 🐧 — from `ls` 📂 to the limitless 🚀. Join me as I debug 🛠️ my way through the shell 💻

Welcome to my Linux learning journey!  
This repository is where I document my daily progress, notes, and experiments with Linux.  
Whether it’s mastering the basics, exploring system internals, or experimenting with commands — it’s all logged here.

I’m learning Linux on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** 🐧💻.  
All commands and examples in this repo are based on Red Hat.
